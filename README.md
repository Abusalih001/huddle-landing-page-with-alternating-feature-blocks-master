## My process

I started by building the HTML on day one and completed it the same day. I then began the CSS, starting with mobile media queries, following a mobile-first workflow. After finalizing the mobile view, I worked on the desktop layout and completed the entire styling on the same day.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Basic DOM and Pop-up feature from Javascript

---

### What I learned

- I learned how to apply different styling for the same elements based on device size using media queries.
- I improved my time management by setting clear goals and deadlines.
- I discovered new features in Flexbox which helped in better layout control.
- I also improved my semantic HTML structure.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to enhance this project by improving my media query usage and introducing JavaScript to add interactivity.
